* Construct a class for a `Deck` of cards, which has an attribute `cards` consisting of an array of 52 `Card` objects.  
* A `Card` consists of a `rank` ("A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K") paired with a `suit` ("Hearts", "Clubs", "Diamonds", "Spades")
* Your `Deck` should have a method `#choose_card` which selects a random card from the deck and removes it.
